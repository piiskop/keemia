abstract = {(a) The electron configurations of many atoms that do not obey the Madelung rule of orbital occupancy can be explained by minimum-energy configurations obtained from the Dirac Hyper Hartree–Fock equations. The resulting non-integral occupation of ns and (n−1)d orbitals (the usual interpretation for energy band calculations in solids) explains eight of the ten `anomalous' configurations. (b) All four d- and f-block atoms whose singly charged cations result from the loss of an (n−1)d electron rather than an ns electron are shown to have (n−1)d rather than ns as their highest occupied energy levels.}

Abstract = {Acceleration is a fundamental concept in physics which is taught in mechanics at all levels. Here, we discuss some challenges in teaching this concept effectively when the path along which the object is moving has a curvature and centripetal acceleration is present. We discuss examples illustrating that both physics teachers and students have difficulty with this concept. We conclude with instructional strategies that may help students with this challenging concept.},
