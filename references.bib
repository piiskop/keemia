abstract = {(a) The electron configurations of many atoms that do not obey the Madelung rule of orbital occupancy can be explained by minimum-energy configurations obtained from the Dirac Hyper Hartree–Fock equations. The resulting non-integral occupation of ns and (n−1)d orbitals (the usual interpretation for energy band calculations in solids) explains eight of the ten `anomalous' configurations. (b) All four d- and f-block atoms whose singly charged cations result from the loss of an (n−1)d electron rather than an ns electron are shown to have (n−1)d rather than ns as their highest occupied energy levels.}
